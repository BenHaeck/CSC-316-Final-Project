# CSC-316-Final-Project
A final project for EKU's CSC 316 course.

# Idea
The idea is that you play as a tank that is trying to shut down an evil AI.
To shut it down you must deatroy all of the AI's generators. These generators act as the level exits.
Programming done by me, and art done by Hailey Geurkink

# Enemies
The game features 4 enemy types. Theres the normal tank, theres the flame throwers, and theres the the drone tanks. Theres also the drones.

# Lighting
the lighting system is incredably simple. It works by drawing a bunch of splotches to an off camera render buffer, then drawing the buffer over the entire screen

# Who did what
I did most of the programming, Hailey did most of the artwork including the pause screen image.
